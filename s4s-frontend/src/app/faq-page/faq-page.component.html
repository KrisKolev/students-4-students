                    A: This website was inspired by already existing services, but with added features.
                    It is intended to be used mostly by students, hence the name. In here only students can register and
                    submit comments or upload locations.

                    A: Creating an account is a very simple step. Click on the "Sign in" button in the top right corner
                    and then click "Create an account".
                    Once you've done that, fill in the fields and use your STUDENT email to register.

                    restaurants or places to visit.
                    But you will not be able to create an account or rate any existing locations.
